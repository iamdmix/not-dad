# Dhyeya Anand Deshpande - OSINT CTF

## Overview

Welcome to the Dhyeya Anand Deshpande OSINT CTF! This challenge centers on a character I’ve created, Dhyeya Anand Deshpande, who has an intricate digital footprint that spans several online platforms. I’ve carefully crafted an immersive experience where participants must use their OSINT skills to uncover hidden information about Dhyeya, a fictional rally driver with a unique background and hobbies.

Throughout this challenge, you’ll need to piece together seemingly unrelated data, decipher subtle clues, and avoid distractions. The key to success is knowing where to look and what to focus on. I’ve intentionally mixed clues with noise to make this both a challenging and rewarding experience.

## About the Character

Dhyeya Anand Deshpande is a deeply thought-out fictional persona. He’s a rally enthusiast with a love for vintage motorcycles, a mechanical engineering background, and an affinity for specific cuisines. Dhyeya’s story is spread out across various platforms, with each platform holding critical clues about his personal and professional life. From his favorite rally tracks to his academic history, there’s a wealth of information waiting to be uncovered—if you know where to look.

The character’s personality shines through social media posts, interests, and interactions, but not everything is straightforward. Some details are hidden in plain sight, while others are buried beneath layers of misleading information. This CTF will test not only your ability to gather open-source intelligence but also your capacity to sift through irrelevant data.

## The Challenge

The Dhyeya Anand Deshpande OSINT CTF was designed to engage and challenge your critical thinking skills. While crafting this character, I focused on making the clues subtle but attainable. Each piece of information is carefully hidden across multiple social media platforms, and it’s up to you to connect the dots. However, not everything you come across is useful—some details are meant to mislead you and add complexity to the challenge.

The CTF encourages you to explore different types of digital footprints. You’ll need to check usernames, inspect profile pictures, scan posts, and observe the fine details that may often go unnoticed. Each clue adds another layer to Dhyeya’s life, and finding all of them will give you a complete picture of his background, interests, and career.

## Platforms Involved

Dhyeya’s fictional story is spread across a variety of online platforms, each serving a different purpose and hiding different clues. These platforms include:

- **Instagram**: Dhyeya’s Instagram is a treasure trove of personal posts, with references to his hobbies, travels, and interests. Some posts are directly related to his rally career, while others are just noise, designed to throw participants off the scent.
  
- **LinkedIn**: On LinkedIn, Dhyeya presents his professional side, showcasing his engineering degree and rally achievements. However, even here, subtle hints and distractions are scattered throughout his profile.

- **Chess.com**: A more unusual platform for a rally driver, but Dhyeya’s chess.com account holds valuable information hidden behind his game history and profile.

- **GitHub**: While GitHub may seem like an odd place for a rally driver, usernames and commits might reveal key data points you wouldn’t expect. Don’t overlook this account in your search.

Each of these platforms plays a crucial role in the CTF, and diving into each one will provide important pieces of the puzzle. However, not everything on these platforms is relevant, so use your investigative skills to discern what matters and what’s just noise.

## My Process

Building this OSINT CTF was an enjoyable and creative process. I took special care to design the challenge with a balance of complexity and accessibility. While some clues are hidden in plain sight, others are embedded in more subtle ways, making the challenge more engaging. 

From brainstorming Dhyeya’s backstory to integrating distractions into his online presence, I aimed to create a character that feels as realistic as possible while still making the CTF fun. It was important to me to add layers to his persona, giving him depth and allowing participants to explore different facets of his life. Creating noise—such as unrelated posts about pets or social events—was equally important in ensuring participants had to focus and separate the relevant details from the irrelevant.

I wanted the challenge to reflect real-life OSINT work, where not all data found online is useful, and participants must sift through both facts and distractions. I had a lot of fun weaving together the details of Dhyeya’s life, and I hope that comes through in the experience for those taking on the CTF.

## Final Thoughts

The Dhyeya Anand Deshpande OSINT CTF is more than just a challenge—it's an exploration of how data, clues, and noise all coexist in the digital world. As you go through the CTF, you’ll have to think like an investigator, using every resource available to uncover the story I’ve hidden across the internet.

This challenge was designed to be a fun and enriching experience for anyone interested in OSINT, from beginners to experts. I hope you enjoy unraveling the mystery behind Dhyeya and have as much fun solving the CTF as I had creating it!

Good luck, and happy hunting!
